bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts. The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametesare found in the ovule. Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther ofone flower to the stigma of the same or another flower. Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. Inself-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to thestigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains aretransferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flowerof the same kind. Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects. The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation. Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo. Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, whichcontains the developing embryo. Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals. Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoidcompetition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.Keywords Asexual reproduction BuddingEmbryoFertilisationFragmentationGametesHyphaOvulePollen grainPollen tubePollinationSeed dispersalSexual reproductionSporeSporangiumVegetative propagationZygote Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 90Exercises 1.
