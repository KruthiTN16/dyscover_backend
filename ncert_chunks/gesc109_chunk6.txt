meters can be seen on the dashboards of cars, buses and other vehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboardof a car. Note that one of the meters has km/h written at one corner. This is called a speedometer . It records theTime taken = Distance/Speed Table 9.4 Fastest speed that some animals can attain S. No. Name of the object Speed in km/h Speed in m/s 1.

While going for a school picnic, Paheli decided to note the reading on theodometer of the bus after every30 minutes till the end of the journey. Later on she recorded her readings in Table 9.5. Can you tell how far was the picnic spot from the school? Can you calculatethe speed of the bus? Looking at theTable, Boojho asked Paheli whether she can tell how far they would have travelled till 9:45 AM. Paheli had noanswer to this question. They went to their teacher. She told them that one way to solve this problem is to plot adistance-time graph. Let us find out how such a graph is plotted.Table 9.5 Odometer reading at different times of the journey Time Odometer Distance from (AM) reading the starting point 8:00 AM 36540 km 0 km 8:30 AM 36560 km 20 km 9:00 AM 36580 km 40 km 9:30 AM 36600 km 60 km10:00 AM 36620 km 80 km9.5 D ISTANCE -TIME GRAPH You might have seen that newspapers, magazines, etc., present information in various forms of graphs to make it Fig. 9.8 A bar graph showing runs scored by a team in each over interesting. The type of graph shown in Fig. 9.8 is known as a bar graph. Another type of graphical representation is a pie chart (Fig. 9.9). The graph shownin Fig. 9.10 is an example of a line graph. The distance-time graph is a line graph.Let us learn to make such a graph.Fig. 9.7 The dashboard of a car Reprint 2024-25 MOTION AND TIME 101 Table 9.6 The motion of a car S. No. Time (min.)

Draw two lines perpendicular to each other on it, as shown in Fig. 9.11. Mark the horizontal line as XOX'. It is known asthe x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical line YOY '. It is called the y-axis. The point of intersection of XOX ' and YOY ' is known as the
