notFig. 11.15 Real images formed by a concave mirror obstruct the light from the candle fallingon the mirror. Is this image real orvirtual? Is it of the same size as the flame? Now move the candle towards the mirror and place it at different distancesfrom it. In each case try to obtain the image on the screen. Record your observation in Table 11.1. Is it possibleto obtain the image on the screen when the candle is too close to the mirror (Fig. 11.16)? We see that the image formed by a concave mirror can be smaller or largerin size than the object. The image mayalso be real or virtual. Concave mirrors are used for many purposes. You might have seen doctorsusing concave mirrors for examining eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave mirrors are also used by dentiststo see an enlarged image of the teeth (Fig. 11.17). The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars and scooters areconcave in shape (Fig. 11.18).

He found that his image was erect and smaller in size. He wonderedif the bell is also a kind of spherical mirror. Can you recognise the type ofthe mirror? Note that the reflecting surface of the bell is convex. Activity 11.8 Repeat Activity 11.7 now with a convexmirror in place of a concave mirror (Fig. 11.19). Record your observations in a Table similar to Table 11.1. Could you get a real image at any distance of the object from the convex Table 11.1 Image formed by a concave mirror for object placed at different distances from it Distance of the object from Smaller/larger Character of the image the mirror than the object Inverted/ erect Real/virtual 50 cm … … 40 cm … … 30 cm20 cm10 cm … 5 cmFig. 11.19 Image formed by a convex mirror Fig. 11.17 A dentist examining a patient Fig. 11.18 Reflector of a torch Concave surface Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 132Fig. 11.20 Convex mirror as side view mirror mirror? Did you get an image larger in size than the object? Can you now recognise the mirrors used as side mirrors in automobiles?These are convex mirrors. Convex mirrorscan form images of objects spread over a large area. So, these help the drivers to see the traffic behind them (Fig. 11.20). 11.5 I MAGES FORMED BY LENSES You might have seen a magnifying glass.It is used to read very small print (Fig. 11.21). You might have also used it to observe the body parts of acockroach or an earthworm. The magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens. Lenses are widely used in spectacles, telescopes and microscopes. Try to adda few more uses of lenses to this list. Get some lenses. Touch and feel them. Can you find some difference justby touching? Those lenses which feel thicker in the middle than at the edgesare convex lenses [Fig. 11.22 (a)].
