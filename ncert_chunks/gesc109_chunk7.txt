origin O. The twoquantities between which the graph is drawn are shown along these two axes.We show the positive values on the x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive values on the y-axis are shown alongOY. In this chapter we shall consider only the positive values of quantities.Therefore, we shall use only the shadedpart of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11. Boojho and Paheli found out the distance travelled by a car and the timetaken by it to cover that distance. Their data is shown in Table 9.6. 2468 10 12 14 16 18 20 2220 10304050607080Weight (in kg) Age (in year)X O X YY You can make the graph by following the steps given below: Draw two perpendicular lines to represent the two axes and markthem as OX and OY as in Fig. 9.11. Decide the quantity to be shownalong the x-axis and that to beshown along the y-axis. In this caseY XOther gases Oxygen Nitrogen Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 102we show the time along the x-axis and the distance along the y-axis. Choose a scale to represent thedistance and another to representthe time on the graph. For the motionof the car scales could be Time: 1 min = 1 cm Distance: 1 km = 1 cm Mark values for the time and thedistance on the respective axes according to the scale you have chosen. For the motion of the carmark the time 1 min, 2 min, … onthe x-axis from the origin O. Similarly, mark the distance 1 km, 2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12). Now you have to mark the points onthe graph paper to represent each set of values for distance and time. Observation recorded at S. No. 1in Table 9.6 shows that at time0 min the distance moved is also zero. The point corresponding to this set of values on the graph willtherefore be the origin itself. After 1minute, the car has moved a distance of 1 km. To mark this set of values look for the point that represents1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a lineparallel to the y-axis at this point. Then draw a line parallel to the x-axis from the point correspondingto distance 1 km on the y-axis. Thepoint where these two lines intersect represents this set of values on the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,mark on the graph paper thepoints corresponding to different sets of values.Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points onthe graph corresponding to positions of the car at various times. Join all the points on the graph as shown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight line. This is the distance-time graph for the motion of the car. If the distance-time graph is a straight line, it indicates that the object is moving with a constantspeed. However, if the speed of the object keeps changing, the graph can be of any other shape.Fig. 9.12 Making a graph Fig. 9.13 Making a graphOXY XO Y Reprint 2024-25 MOTION AND TIME 103Generally, the choice of scales is not as simple as in
