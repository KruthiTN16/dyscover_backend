Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When theRomans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes usedmirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 11.34. The mirrors could be moved in anydirection. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on theRoman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did notknow what was happening. They got confused and ran away.
