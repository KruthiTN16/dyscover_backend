the mouth in small lumps and the animal chews it. This process is called rumination and these animals are called ruminants . The grass is rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate.

When it senses food, it pushes out pseudopodia around the food particle and engulfs it. The food becomes trapped in a food vacuole [Fig. 2.10). Digestive juices are secreted into the food vacuole. They act on the food andbreak it down into simpler substances. Gradually the digested food is absorbed.The absorbed substances are used for growth, maintenance and multiplication.The undigested residue of the food is expelled outside by the vacuole. The basic process of digestion of food and release of energy is the samein all animals. In a later chapter you will learn about the transport of foodabsorbed by the intestine to the various parts of the body. What you have learnt Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food and its utilisation in the body. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal andsecretory glands. It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus,(iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectumand (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juicesare (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomachwall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices. The modes of feeding vary in different organisms. Nutrition is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion,(iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and (v) egestion.Keywords Absorption Amino acidAmoebaAssimilation Bile Buccal cavityCanineCelluloseDigestionEgestionFatty acidFood vacuoleGall bladderGlycerolIncisor Ingestion LiverMilk teethMolarPermanent teethOesophagusPancreasPremolarPseudopodiaRumen Ruminant RuminationSalivary glandsVilli Saliva Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 20 Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from theliver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juicefrom the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of foodin the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vesselsfrom the small intestine. The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in thelarge intestine. The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the bodyas faeces through the anus. The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known asruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it inthe rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews itpeacefully. Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.The food is digested in the food vacuole. Exercises 1.
