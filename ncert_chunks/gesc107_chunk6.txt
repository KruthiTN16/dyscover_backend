tissue called the phloem . Thus, xylem and phloem transport substances in plants. Activity 7.3 We would require a glass tumbler, water, red ink, a tender herb (e.g., Balsam), and a blade for this activity. Pour water to fill one-third of the tumbler. Add a few drops of red ink tothe water. Cut the base of the stem ofthe herb and place it in the glass as shown in Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.

It also carries waste productsfrom different parts of the body for excretion. Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels. In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart actsas a pumping organ. Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due tothe presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin. The human heart beats about 70–80 times per minute in an adultperson. This is called heart rate. Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body. Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.Transpiration In Class VI you learnt that plants release a lot of water by the process of transpiration. Plants absorb mineral nutrients and water from the soil. Not all the waterabsorbed is utilised by the plant. The water evaporates through the stomata presenton the surface of the leaves by the process of transpiration. The evaporation of waterfrom leaves generates a suction pull (the same that you produce when you suck water through a straw) which canpull water to great heights in the tall trees. Transpiration also cools the plant.
