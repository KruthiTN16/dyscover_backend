the example given in Fig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to choose two different scales to represent the desired quantities on the x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to understand this process with an example. Let us again consider the motion of the bus that took Paheli and her friends to the picnic. The distance covered and time taken by the bus are shown inTable 9.5. The total distance covered bythe bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to draw an axis of length 80 cm. This isnot possible on a sheet of paper. On theother hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would require an axis of length only 8 cm. This scale is quite convenient. However, thegraph may cover only a small part ofthe graph paper. Some of the points to be kept in mind while choosing the most suitable scale for drawing a graph are:the difference between the highest and the lowest values of eachquantity. the intermediate values of eachquantity, so that with the scalechosen it is convenient to mark the values on the graph, and to utilise the maximum part of the paper on which the graph is to be drawn. Suppose that you are given a graph paper of size 25 cm × 25 cm. One of the scales which meets the above conditionsand can accommodate the data of Table9.5 could be Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, andTime: 6 min = 1 cmCan you now draw the distance-time graph for the motion of the bus? Is thegraph drawn by you similar to thatshown in Fig. 9.13? Distance-time graphs provide a variety of information about the motionFig. 9.14 Distance-time graph of the busY X Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 104when compared to the data presented by a table. For example, Table 9.5 givesinformation about the distance moved by the bus only at some definite time intervals. On the other hand, from thedistance-time graph we can find the distance moved by the bus at any instant of time. Suppose we want toknow how much distance the bus had travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on the x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point is A. Next we draw a line perpendicular to the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) atpoint A. We then mark the point, T, onthe graph at which this perpendicularline intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we draw a line through the point T parallel to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axisat the point B. The distance corresponding to the point B on the y- axis, OB, gives us the distance in kmcovered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How much is this distance in km? Can younow help Paheli to find the distancemoved by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also find the speed of the bus from itsdistance-time graph?
