where leguminous Boojho says once his grandfather told him that his wheat fields were spoiled by a fungus. He wants to know if fungi cause diseases also. Paheli told him that many fungi like yeast and mushrooms are useful, but some fungi cause diseases in plants, animals including humans. Some fungi are also used as medicines. wet and warm things they germinate and grow. Now, can you figure out how we can protect our things from gettingspoiled? Some organisms live together and share both shelter and nutrients. Thisrelationship is called symbiosis . For example, certain fungi live inside theroots of plants. The plants providenutrients to the fungus and, in return, the fungus provides water and certain nutrients. In organisms called lichens , a chlorophyll-containing partner, which isan alga, and a fungus live together. Thefungus provides shelter, water and minerals to the alga and, in return, the alga prepares and provides food to thefungus. Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 8 What you have learnt All organisms need food and utilise it to get energy for growth and maintenance of their body. Green plants synthesise food for themselves by the process of photosynthesis. They are autotrophs. Plants like Cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant. Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and minerals for the synthesis of food. Chlorophyll, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight are the essentialrequirements for photosynthesis. Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the productsof photosynthesis. Solar energy is absorbed by the chlorophylls present in leaves/plants. Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis. Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by living organisms fortheir survival. Many fungi derive nutrition from dead and decaying matter. They are saprotrophs. A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition and are called heterotrophs.plants are grown. Most of the pulses (dals) are obtained from leguminous plants. In this chapter you learnt that most of the plants are autotrophs. Only a few plants are parasitic orsaprotrophic. They derive nutritionfrom other organisms. All animals arecategorised as heterotrophs sincethey depend on plants and other animals for food. Can we say that the insectivorous plants are partialheterotrophs ?

Why do organisms take food? 2. Distinguish between a parasite and a saprotroph.3. How would you test the presence of starch in leaves?4. Give a brief description of the process of synthesis of food in green plants.5. Show with the help of a sketch that plants are the ultimate source of food. 6. Fill in the blanks: (a) Green plants are called _________________ since they synthesise their own food. (b) The food synthesised by plants is stored as _________________. (c) In photosynthesis solar energy is absorbed by the pigment called ___________. (d) During photosynthesis plants take in ______________________ and release __________________ gas. 7. Name the following: (i) A parasitic plant with yellow, slender and branched stem. (ii) A plant that is partially autotrophic. (iii) The pores through which leaves exchange
