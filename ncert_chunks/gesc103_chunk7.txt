coloured clothes reflect most of the heat that falls on them and, therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them in the summer. Woollen clothes keep us warm in winter In the winter, we use woollen clothes. Wool is a poor conductor of heat. Moreover, there is air trapped in betweenthe wool fibres. This air prevents the flowof heat from our body to the coldsurroundings. So, we feel warm. Suppose you are given the choice in winter of using either one thick blanketor two thin blankets joined together.What would you choose and why?Remember that there would be a layerof air in between the blankets.Fig. 3.12 Containers with black and white surface Keywords Celsius scale ConductionConductor ConvectionInsulator Land breezeRadiationSea breeze TemperatureThermometer Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 34 What you have learnt Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness of an object. Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object. Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperature. Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. Therange of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°C. For other purposes, weuse the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers isusually from –10°C to 110°C. The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C. The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lowertemperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from oneobject to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation. In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquidsand gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is requiredfor transfer of heat by radiation. The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily areconductors of heat. The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily arecalled insulators. Dark-coloured objects absorb more heat than the light-coloured objects.That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured clothes inthe summer. Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is apoor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres. Exercises 1. State similarities and differences between the laboratory thermometer and the clinical thermometer. 2. Give two examples each of conductors and insulators of heat. 3. Fill in the blanks : (a) The hotness of an object is determined by its __________.(b) Temperature of boiling water cannot be measured by a _____________ thermometer. (c) Temperature is measured in degree ______________. Reprint 2024-25 HEAT 35(d) No medium is required for transfer of heat by the process of __________. (e) A cold steel spoon is dipped in a cup of hot milk. Heat is transferred to its other end by the process of ______________. (f ) Clothes of ______________ colours absorb more heat better than clothes of light colours. 4. Match the following : (i) Land breeze blows during (a) summer (ii) Sea breeze blows during (b) winter (iii) Dark coloured clothes are preferred during (c) day (iv) Light coloured clothes are preferred during (d) night 5.
