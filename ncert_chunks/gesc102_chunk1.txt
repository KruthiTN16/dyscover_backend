Nutrition in Animals2 You have learnt in Chapter 1 that plants can prepare their own food by the process of photosynthesis but animals cannot. Animals get their food from plants, either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that eat plants. Some animalseat both plants and animals. Recall that all organisms including humans require food for growth, repair and functioningof the body. Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intakeof food and its utilisation in the body. You have studied in Class VI that food consists of many components. Try torecall and list them below: 1. ______________________ 2. ______________________3. ______________________ 4. ______________________ 5. ______________________6. ______________________ The components of food such as carbohydrates are complex substances. These complex substances cannot beutilised as such. So they are broken down into simpler substances. The breakdown of complex components ofTable 2.1 Various modes of feeding Name of Kind of Mode of animal food feeding SnailAntEagle Humming-bird LiceMosquito Butterfly House fly(Scraping, chewing, siphoning, capturing and swallowing, sponging, sucking etc.)food into simpler substances is called digestion. 2.1 D IFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD The mode of taking food into the body varies in different organisms. Bees and humming-birds suck the nectar ofplants, infants of human and many other animals feed on mother’s milk. Snakes like the python swallow theanimals they prey upon. Some aquatic animals filter tiny food particles floating nearby and feed upon them. Activity 2.1 What is the type of food and mode offeeding of the following animals? Write down your observations in the given Table. You may find the list of modes offeeding given below the Table helpful.

After opening the shell, the starfish pops out its stomach through itsmouth to eat the soft animal inside the shell. The stomach then goes back into the body and the food is slowlydigested. 2.2 D IGESTION IN HUMANS We take in food through the mouth,digest and utilise it. The unused partsof the food are defecated. Have you ever wondered what happens to the food inside the body? The food passesthrough a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2) which begins at the buccal cavity and ends at the anus. The canal can bedivided into various compartments: (1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or oesophagus , (3) stomach , (4) small intestine, (5) large intestine ending in the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a very long path? These parts together form the alimentary canal (digestive tract). The food components graduallyget digested as food travels through thevarious compartments. The inner wallsof the stomach and the small intestine,and the various glands associated with thecanal such as salivary glands , the liver and the pancreas secrete digestive juices. The digestive juices convert complex substances of food into simpler ones. The digestive tract and the associated glands together constitute the digestive system . Now, let us know what happens to the food in different parts
