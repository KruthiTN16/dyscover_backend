It is virtual and is of the same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind themirror as the object is in front of it. In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on theright side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on theleft side in the image. A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object isplaced very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect andmagnified. Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in sizethan the object. A convex lens can form real and inverted image. When the object isplaced very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect andmagnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is calleda magnifying glass. A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than theobject. White light is composed of seven colours.Concave lens Concave mirrorConvex lens Convex mirror Erect image Reprint 2024-25 SCIENCE 138Exercises 1.
