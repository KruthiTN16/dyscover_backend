Nutrition in Animals2
You have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animalseat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioningof the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intakeof food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try torecall and list them below:

2.1 D IFFERENT  WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar ofplants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother’s milk.
Snakes like the python swallow theanimals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

Fig. 2.1  StarfishAmazing fact
Starfish feeds on animals covered by
hard shells of calcium carbonate.
After opening the shell, the starfish
pops out its stomach through itsmouth to eat the soft animal inside
the shell. The stomach then goes back
into the body and the food is slowlydigested.
2.2 D IGESTION  IN HUMANS
We take in food through the mouth,digest and utilise it. The unused partsof the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passesthrough a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can bedivided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus , (3) stomach , (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum  and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal  (digestive
tract). The food components graduallyget digested as food travels through thevarious compartments. The inner wallsof the stomach and the small intestine,and the various glands associated with thecanal such as salivary glands , the liver
and the pancreas secrete digestive juices.
The digestive juices convert complex
substances of food into simpler ones. The
digestive tract and the associated glands
together constitute the digestive system .
Now, let us know what happens to
the food in different parts of the digestivetract.

the food with the teeth and break itdown mechanically into small pieces.Each tooth is rooted in a separate socket
in the gums (Fig. 2.3). Our teeth vary in
appearance and perform differentfunctions. Accordingly they are given
different names (Fig. 2.3).

Boiled and chewed rice
Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteriabreak down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay . If it is not
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and
dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between twoteeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day andrinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

The foodpipe/oesophagus
The swallowed food passes into thefoodpipe or oesophagus. Look at Fig. 2.2.
The foodpipe runs along the neckSometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough,
get hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter thewindpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act ofswallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked, get hiccups or cough.

SCIENCE 16The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a holein his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properlyand left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as
a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach
through the hole. He made some wonderfulobservations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digestthe food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine
only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed.
and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig.  2.7).At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eatingand think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Itsshape is like a flattened J and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. Itreceives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid anddigestive juices. The mucous protectsthe lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with thefood and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic and helps the digestivejuices to act. The digestive juices break
down the proteins  into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receivessecretions from the liver and the pancreas.
Besides, its wall also secretes juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of theabdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below thestomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juiceacts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins
and changes them into simpler forms.

NUTRITION  IN ANIMALS 17Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled waterwith a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).The partly digested food now reaches thelower part of the small intestine wherethe intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken intosimple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine havethousands of finger-like outgrowths.These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi couldbe in the intestine? The villi increasethe surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close toits surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transportedvia the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as theproteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation . In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen
into carbon dioxide and water, and
energy is released. The food thatremains undigested and unabsorbed
enters into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorterthan small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb  waterand some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there assemi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

Boojho wants to know why

Rumenhelps in digestion of cellulose. Many
animals, including humans, cannotdigest cellulose.
Animals like horses, rabbit, etc., have
a large sac-like structure called Caecum
between the oesophagus and the small
intestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the
food is digested here by the action of
certain bacteria which are not present in
humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. Butthere are many small organisms which do
not have a mouth and a digestive system.Then, how do they acquire and digest
food? In the section below you will learn
another interesting way of food intake.
2.4 F EEDING  AND DIGESTION  IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celledorganism found in pond water. Amoebahas a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, ormore finger-like projections, calledpseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.

these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?
partially digested and is called cud.
But later the cud returns to the mouth
in small lumps and the animal chews
it. This process is called rumination  and
these animals are called ruminants .
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. In ruminants like cattle,deer, etc., bacteria present in rumen

NUTRITION  IN ANIMALS 19
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food andbreak it down into simpler substances.
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the samein all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of foodabsorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.

Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The
digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from theliver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juicefrom the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of foodin the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vesselsfrom the small intestine.
The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in thelarge intestine.
The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the bodyas faeces through the anus.
The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known asruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it inthe rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews itpeacefully.
Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.The food is digested in the food vacuole.
